# Partner Center SDK for Java

The Partner Center SDK for Java is commonly used by partners and [control panel vendors](/partner-center/enroll-as-cpv) to manage Partner Center resources. It is an open source project maintained by the partner community. Since this SDK is maintained by the partner community, it is not officially supported by Microsoft.
